# Technical Competence Evaluation
Please   provide   your   evaluation   of   the  technical   competence   of   the   apprentice   using   the tables below. Under each heading are details of the activities that a competent apprentice should be able to demonstrate by the time that they are judged ready, by you, your chosen training provider and the apprentice themselves, to apply for the EPA.

We   strongly   recommend   that   you   continually   review   your   apprentice   against   these competences   throughout   the   duration   of   the   apprenticeship   and   periodically   update   this document. A suitable time to add comments and evidence could be during your performance reviews (or similar) with your apprentice.
